# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
In this analysis we used machine learning techniques to build and evaluate models based on a credit card dataset. The models will then be used to predict credit card risk. In this project we used the imbalance-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate six machine learning models. The algorithms that were used to create the models are as follows:

1) RandomOverSampler
2) SMOTE
3) ClusterCentroids
4) SMOTEENN
5) BalancedRandomForestClassifier
6) EasyEnsemblerClassifier
