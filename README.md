# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
In this analysis we used machine learning techniques to build and evaluate models based on a credit card dataset. The models will then be used to predict credit card risk. In this project we used the imbalance-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate six machine learning models. The methods and respective algorithms that were used to create the models are as follows:

1) Naive Random Oversampling -> RandomOverSampler algorithm 
2) SMOTE Oversampling -> SMOTE algorithm
3) Undersampling -> ClusterCentroids algorithm
4) Combination (Over and Under) Sampling -> SMOTEENN algorithm
5) Balanced Random Forest Classifier -> BalancedRandomForestClassifier algorithm
6) Easy Ensemble Adaboost Classifier -> EasyEnsemblerClassifier
